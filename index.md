# Professional Self-Assessment
## Computer Science program review

<p>	This program prepared me for a career in the field of computer science in multiple ways. It covered technical skills such as coding in multiple languages including: C++, Java, JavaScript and Python. These courses provided instruction on how to build and properly utilize various data structures including: arrays, linked lists and vectors. Proper algorithm construction was covered from the initial stages with pseudocode to designing robust tests for validation and best practices for security and formatting.</p>

<p>Configuration control using Git was also included. Multiple IDEs were used including Eclipse and Microsoft Visual Studio. Database management and manipulation was covered in multiple courses and included relational databases such as MySql and non-relational databases such as MongoDB. This included basic CRUD functions as well as designing and optimizing the database for fast query return and managing use access and security. The program also covered multiple operating systems including Windows and Linux.</p>

<p>	Aside from the above technical skills, the program also including multiple courses on team collaboration, project management and communicating to stakeholders. These skills are essential to complete complex tasks and coordinate within and across teams. The AGILE approach and Scrum methodology were covered in depth and one course required us to work in groups of 4-6 on a single project utilizing Git to track and review progress. Understanding, communicating and designing for use cases was reinforced across multiple courses and the cost of poor communication as well poor testing/validation was highlighted.</p>

## Artifacts
<p>     The artifacts I’ve chosen to include demonstrate a range of computer science abilities that include pure software development, software engineering and database management. These artifacts show experience in multiple programming languages and environments and across multiple disciplines such as information systems, programming and electrical engineering. I’ve included three artifacts in this portfolio that highlight skills and experience in the following areas: </p>

* <a href = "lcr.md">Algorithms and Data Structure</a>
* <a href = "https://github.com/cmhenwood/cmhenwood.github.io/blob/master/arduino.md">Software Design and Engineering</a>
* <a href = "mongo.md">Databases</a>

<p>     The algorithms and data structures artifact is a simulated dice game in C++ called LCR or left center right. It utilizes class structures, vectors, loops, conditionals, calls external resources/files and takes input from the user. An informal code review and enhanced code walkthrough are included in <a href = "lcr.md">this artifact.</a> </p>

<p>The software design and engineering artifact is an Arduino Uno project called Spaceship Interface. This artifact includes a schematic of the circuit as well as the code, a video demonstration and a video walkthrough of <a href = "https://github.com/cmhenwood/cmhenwood.github.io/blob/master/arduino.md">the artifact.</a></p>

<p>The database artifact shows work with MongoDB and includes utilizing Python scripting and a RESTful API. The code and explanation are included in <a href = "mongo.db">the artifact.</a></p>
